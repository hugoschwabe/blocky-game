<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## üß± About The Project

<section class="section">
    <p>
      <strong>Blocky Game</strong> is a lightweight Minecraft-inspired sandbox game built entirely with web technologies,
      aiming to bring block-based building and exploration into the browser ‚Äî no installation required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is both a fun creative outlet and a technical demonstration of what's possible using modern
      web APIs and 3D rendering in JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h2>üéØ Goal</h2>
    <p>To create a browser-based Minecraft clone with core features such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Block placement and removal</li>
      <li>First-person controls</li>
      <li>Simple world physics (gravity, collision, jumping)</li>
      <li>Basic terrain structure and interaction</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul class="tech-list">
      <li><strong>Three.js</strong> ‚Äì Core 3D rendering library to handle scenes, cameras, and lighting.</li>
